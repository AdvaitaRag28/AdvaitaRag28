## Advaita Raghavan

I am a second year Computer Science and Linguistics student at Northeastern University. I am interested in software development and have been learning program design and Natural Language Processing techniques in my coursework which has led me to explore areas like AI engineering as well.

I'm actively seeking a co-op opportunity where I can apply skills I have learned in the classroom to real-world contexts and gain exposure to different industry practices. I'd love to learn more about opportunities at your organization and discuss how I might contribute to your projects.
